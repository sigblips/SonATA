No copyright statement needs to be provided if you just ship binary executables of your software products.
You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using DOC software. Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the DOC software code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an open-source development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're using DOC software in your software, though we encourage you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software success stories.

The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC Group at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center for Distributed Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the development of open-source software as part of the open-source software community.

File: sse-pkg/web/nss-web-tomcat-base/webapps/prelude/WEB-INF/lib/AstroLib.jar

http://mhuss.com/AstroLib/docs/Overview.html

This is a library of (hopefully) useful astronomical algorithms. This library is based on a class-oriented C++ library I wrote. The C++ library, in turn, was originally based on the C source code written by Bill Gray and available at the Project Pluto website.

It has been "transmogrified" a bit since it's origins. I've changed some things, reorganized some things, and added some things, using information from Jean Meeus' excellent book Astronomical Algorithms.

The biggest differences between this code and the Bill's original code are

It's in Java (duh ;-), so everything is a class or part of a class.
I added a lot of static constants to avoid "magic numbers" as much as possible - there's plenty enough of those in the orbital elements and formulas!
I used native types like int whereever possible, dropping Bill's original byte-frugal storage strategies. This eliminates Bill's "wrong-endian" byte alignment worries. In addition, Java only runs on 32-bit general-purpose platforms, so there's no need to fit things in a 64K segment :-).
I unwound some of Bill's clever algorithm implementations. I find as I get older (and hopefully wiser) that performance can always be tweaked if necessary, but code readability needs to be "baked in."
I formerly used this code to run astronomical servlets on the DVAA web site, in particular, a lunar phase display on the home page, and a Darkness Planner information page. Unfortunately, our provider dropped java support(!), so these are no longer available there. :-(

Questions are welcome.

Copyright Restrictions: In the spirit of Bill's original source, you are free to use this for non-commercial purposes - but please give us a mention if you do so! For commercial usage, please contact me first.

File: sse-pkg/jseeker/WaterfallDisplay.java and BaselineDisplay.java


Files BaselineDisplay.java (lines 705-714) and WaterfallDisplay.java (lines 1336-1345) located in the materials contain forensically significant textual similarities to the file Utils.java (lines 14-23) from Sun's Swing Tutorial. The code is nearly identical.

The Utils.java source code is available at:
